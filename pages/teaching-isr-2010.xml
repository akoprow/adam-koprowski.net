	<content>
		<heading>What</heading>
		<EM>Coq and rewriting</EM>: a series of 3 lectures/lab sessions given as part of the advanced track of the 
		<A href="http://www.phil.uu.nl/isr2010/">5th International School on Rewriting (ISR '10)</A> in Utrecht, Netherlands.
		
		<heading>Abstract</heading>
		<P>
			<EM>Coq</EM> is an interactive theorem prover. On the one hand it allows to express mathematical theorems and mechanically 
			check correctness of their proofs. On the other hand it encompasses a functional programming language, allowing to write 
			programs within the system and reason about their correctness, hence providing a software verification platform. This course 
			will:
			<UL>
				<LI>introduce Coq as a tool;</LI>
				<LI>present recent work in the term rewriting community on using theorem proving technology to certify termination proofs 
					for term rewriting systems; and	</LI>
				<LI>include lab sessions, where students will be presented with a number of exercises, giving them an opportunity to have 
					a hands-on experience with the system.</LI>
			</UL>

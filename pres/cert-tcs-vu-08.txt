Title: Certification of Arctic Termination

Abstract:
 Termination is an important concept in term rewriting. Recently the
emphasis in this field is on automation. To stimulate progress in
this area an annual termination competition is organized, where
tools compete on a set of termination problems. However, as they,
and the methods used by them, are becoming more and more complex
reliability of the results starts to be a critical issue.

 In the first part of my talk I will give an overview of the CoLoR
project (http://color.loria.fr) - a project that tries to address
this issue by transforming proof candidates produced by termination
tools to formal proofs that can be verified by the proof assistant
Coq.

 In the second part of the talk I will briefly introduce the
termination method of arctic matrix interpretations, which extends
the method of matrix interpretations and which was formalized in
CoLoR.

  Semantic labelling is a transformational method for proving termination of TRSs. It is well-known 
for many years but, up till now, in all tools proving termination automatically if it is used it is 
used with booleans (or finite sets) as labels. For many interesting examples this is not sufficient 
while using natural numbers for labels is. One of the problems with labelling using natural numbers 
is that transformed TRSs are infinite thus this method was believed not to be suitable for automatic 
termination provers.

  In this talk I will try to refute this opinion by presenting how semantic labelling with natural 
numbers was successfully implemented in TPA (Termination Proved Automatically, http://www.win.tue.nl/tpa), 
a tool for proving termination automatically of my authorship. I will explain how other techniques 
(polynomial orderings and recursive path ordering in particular) have been adapted in order to be used 
in combination with semantic labelling with natural numbers. I will also try to give a general overview 
of TPA.

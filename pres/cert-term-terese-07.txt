Title: Certification of Termination

Abstract: For few years the emphasis in the research area of
termination of term rewriting is on automation. Since 2004 the
annual termination competition is being held, that stimulates
development of tools for proving termination. Every year the tools
and the proofs generated by them get more involved. The former
means that the tools, inevitably, will (and do) contain some bugs.
The latter means that the generated proofs are more and more
difficult to verify by hand.

This was the motivation for the CoLoR project, started by Frederic
Blanqui. CoLoR stands for Coq Library on Rewriting and Termination
and, as the name suggests, its goal is to provide a library of
theoretical results concerning termination of term rewriting,
verified in the Coq theorem prover. It is accompanied by Rainbow:
a mechanism aiming at translating, with the help of CoLoR,
termination proofs generated by the tools into complete Coq proofs
certifying termination.

In this talk I will try to give an overview of the present status
of the works on certification. I will also zoom-in into our recent
contribution to this field: formalization of matrix
interpretations.

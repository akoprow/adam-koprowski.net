  Termination is an important concept in term rewriting. The idea of my PhD project 
is to use it for verification purposes, in particular for verification of liveness 
properties.

  In the first part of the talk I will give an overview of the work that has been done 
so far and I will discuss its different aspects. In the second part I will present 
our recent development (joint work with Hans Zantema) of a new termination technique: 
adaptation of recursive path ordering (termination technique due to Dershowitz) to 
infinite systems obtained by semantic labelling (termination technique due to Zantema) 
with natural numbers.

  Liveness is roughly defined as "something will eventually happen" and it is often remarked that 
"termination is a particular case of liveness". But conversely liveness can be seen as termination 
of a modified relation. Since various techniques for proving termination (also fully automatically) 
exist and are being developed it is of interest to further investigate this relation.

  In this talk I will present the transformation from liveness problems to problems of termination of 
term rewrite systems (TRSs). Its advantage over techniques like model checking is that it can easily 
deal with infinite state space models. Further, I will illustrate it on a toy-example and discuss its 
relation with similar transformation invented by Jurgen Giesl and Hans Zantema in 2003. Time 
permitting; I will also present the proof of soundness and sketch the proof of completeness of 
presented transformation.

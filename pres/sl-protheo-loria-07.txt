Title: Semantic labeling for proving termination of term rewriting
Abstract:
  Semantic labeling was invented in 1995 by Zantema. It is a
technique for proving termination of term rewriting by attaching
semantics to function symbols, deriving labels from it and using
this additional information in termination proofs. At the beginning
it was implemented in automatic termination tools only for finite
domains. Later on this approach was extended (Koprowski, Zantema) to
infinite models in the termination prover TPA, which, most notably,
allowed to prove termination of the difficult SUBST system. In a
recent line of research the technique has been improved, giving rise
to predictive labeling (Hirokawa, Middeldorp) which was generalized
to dependency pairs setting (Koprowski, Middeldorp) and to innermost
termination (Thiemann, Middeldorp). In this talk I will try to give
an overview of those developments with a special emphasis on
automation for use in automatic termination provers.

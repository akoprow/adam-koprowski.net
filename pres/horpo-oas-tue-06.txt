Title: Certified Higher-Order Recursive Path Ordering.
Abstract: 
  Recursive path ordering (RPO) is a well-known reduction ordering (Dershowitz, 1982) 
for proving termination of (first order) term rewriting systems (TRSs). Jouannaud and 
Rubio (in 1999) generalized this ordering to higher-order case thus creating the 
higher-order recursive path ordering (HORPO). They proved that this is a higher-order 
reduction ordering which essentially comes down to proving well-foundedness of the 
union of HORPO and beta-reduction relation of simply typed lambda calculus. The work 
described in this talk involves formalization of this proof in theorem prover Coq.

  In the first part of the talk I will give a very brief introduction to simply typed 
lambda calculus, RPO, higher-order rewriting and HORPO. Then I will present a general 
overview of the formalization. Finally I will present one particular problem encountered 
in the course of this work: dealing with equivalence of terms extending the idea of 
alpha-conversion to free variables. I will also present the solution to this problem 
that has been employed in this development.
